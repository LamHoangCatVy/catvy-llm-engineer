### Definition
**RS (Relative Strength)** is a measure used in technical analysis to evaluate how a particular asset's price performance compares to another asset or to the overall market. It helps traders understand whether an asset is gaining or losing strength compared to its peer or trend.

### Related Concepts and Terms
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: An indicator that uses RS to measure the speed and change of price movements, helping traders identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Market Indicator**: Metrics used by traders to assess the current market conditions and make decisions.
- **Trend Analysis**: An approach to predicting the direction of prices by analyzing historical price movements.
- **Benchmark**: A standard against which the performance of a security or portfolio can be measured.

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **Stock Market Analysis**: Investors can use RS to compare the performance of a specific stock against a market index (like the S&P 500) to see if it's outperforming or underperforming.
2. **Asset Management**: Portfolio managers utilize RS to adjust their holdings, opting for assets with stronger RS values (indicating better performance) and selling those with weaker values.
3. **Relative Performance Evaluation**: Mutual funds or hedge funds assess their investment choices based on RS to ensure they are selecting the best performing assets.

### Formula
The Relative Strength (RS) is typically calculated using the formula:

\[
RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}
\]

### Practical Examples
1. **Calculating RS for a Stock**: Suppose Stock A has had average gains of $2 per day over a 14-day period and average losses of $1 per day over the same period. The RS for Stock A would be:

   \[
   RS = \frac{2}{1} = 2
   \]

   This indicates that Stock A is gaining strength compared to its losses.

2. **Using RS in RSI Calculation**: If we take the above example of Stock A, we can now proceed to calculate the RSI for it, which is commonly used as an indicator of overbought or oversold market conditions:

\[
RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)
\]

If we plug in the RS we calculated:

\[
RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + 2} \right) = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{3} \right) = 100 - 33.33 = 66.67
\]

An RSI of 66.67 suggests that Stock A is approaching the overbought territory, indicating a potential selling point.

In summary, RS is a valuable tool for investors and traders to gauge the relative performance of assets and make informed decisions based on statistical comparisons with benchmarks.
